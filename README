- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
    ```

3. **Change dir into ./dashboard** :

    cd <repo_name>/dashboard
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

## Running the Dashboard

1. **Run Streamlit**:
